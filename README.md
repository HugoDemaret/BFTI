BFTI stands for "Binary File To Image".
This program generates an image from an ASCII file.
For now, it is not meant to prevent stack buffer overflow. Maybe this will be corrected in the future
Work In Progress: the code isn't working yet

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This code supports ASCII code and Binary code. It does not (and will not) support unicode characters as it isn't intended to do so. Using unicode might result in errors (that's alright), or in stack buffer overflow (not good).
